# Neural Networks

- What is each object's decision-making process?
- How can it adjust its choices by learning over time?
- Can a computational entity process its environment and generate a decision?

## Introduction & Application

- *1943*: Warren S. Mulloch and Walter Pitts developed the first model of an ANN
    - They describe the concept of a neuron, a single cell living in a network of cells that recieves inputs, processes those inputs, and generates an output
- Not a faithful description of the biological brain
- Common application is "easy for a human, difficult for a machine" tasks, often referred to as pattern recognition

- A "connectionist" computational system
- Not linear, but parallel through a network of nodes
- Adaptive complex systems change internal structures based on information
- Each connection has a weight

- 3 types of learning
    - Supervised
    - Unsupervised
    - Reinforcement

- Common Uses of ANN
    - Pattern Recognition
    - Time Series Prediction
    - Signal Processing
    - Control (self-driving cars)
    - Soft sensors
    - Anomaly detection

## The Perception

- **Perceptron** a simplest NN; a computational model of a single neuron with x inputs, a processor, and a single output
